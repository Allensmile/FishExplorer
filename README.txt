To start:
Open "GUIpreload_step4_loadGUI.m" 
Change Matlab's current folder to folder containing this m-file.
Run this file and GUI should start.

Main code is in "GUI_FishExplorer.m".

For most fish, only data from 2 clusters are saved into "CONSTs_current.mat".
Only full data for one example fish, Fish 6, is included. 
To view data of full fish, under tab "General", select "6" in drop-down menu "Load full fish". Then most functions can be used. 

To see some example selections of cells, go to tab "Saved Clusters", and browse drop-down menus "Class" and "Clusters".

In tab "Operations", use the "Back" and "Forward" button to access the previous views. "Choose cluster range" takes inputs like "1-3,5" or "2:end". Cluster range are indicated by the numbers next to the color bar. 

For descriptions of the other functions, please read the description at the top of "GUI_FishExplorer.m".

Please let me know if you have any questions!
